### FabScanPi 0.4.3 and updated documentation. (2017-07-26)
First of all i would like to thank all FabScanPi builders/users/community members for 
reporting bugs and sharing experiences. Special thanks goes to Jens Hackel for his
awesome job on writing a lot of the FabScanPi documentation. 

Some users mentioned problems with FabScanPi HAT serial connection. We added a troubleshooting 
guide to the [F.A.Q](http://mariolukas.github.io/FabScanPi-Server/faq/#hardware) section of the 
documentation.

Changelog for this version: 

 * Auto-calibration values are saved and available after a reboot. 
 * Meshing was refactored. 
 * Meshing filters are reduced to two basic filters to prevent confusion 
 * Added new output formats to meshing. Available formats are ply, stl, obj, off, xyz, x3d, 3ds now.

### New FabScanPi release with auto calibration (2017-02-01)
A new release of the FabScanPi software with some new exciting features:

 * Auto-calibration improves the scan results and simplifies the setup process.
 * Read news from the FabScanPi project to stay informed about new features and improvements.
 * Improved updates allow to update your installation with one click.
 * fixed some major BUG's
 * refactored serial communication

Have fun!
